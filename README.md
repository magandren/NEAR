# NEAR Personal Project!

This past summer, I was grateful to have the opportunity to learn more about blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptomoney with NEAR. With the NEAR Bootcamp, I was able to apply the resources and materials provided to my own smart contract and presented it to my fellow classmates.

For my contract, I decided to create a melody generator, where the user is able to create a melody and then record in a "Guest Book". 
The "Guest Book" closesly outlines the NEAR Guest Book example here: https://github.com/near-examples/guest-book 

In the future, I would like to implement a unqiue melody compenent where the user is able to own the melody (an NFT) and 
also potentially allow greater variations/options for our generated melodies.
